Key Features:
1. Word Display and Typing Mechanics:

    Words are randomly generated and displayed in a scrollable interface. Each word is broken down into individual letters, and users must type the words correctly.
    The current word and letter are visually highlighted to guide the user during gameplay.
    The game adjusts in real time based on user inputs, providing immediate feedback on the accuracy of each typed letter.
2. Real-time Scoring and Feedback:

   The game calculates typing speed in words per minute (WPM) based on the number of correctly typed words within the time limit.
   If an incorrect letter is typed, it is marked in red, while correct letters are marked in white.
   The game also features a dynamic cursor that follows the userâ€™s typing position on the screen.
3. Game Over Mechanism:

    After the 30-second timer runs out, the game ends and displays the final WPM score.
    A "New Game" button allows users to restart the game, resetting the word list and timer.

4. Keyboard Navigation:

    Users can interact with the game using the keyboard, typing letters, spaces, and using backspace to correct mistakes.
    The game captures various key events and dynamically updates the display according to the user's input.
5. Responsive and Visually Engaging:

    The design uses SVG icons and responsive layouts to ensure the game is visually appealing on different screen sizes.
    CSS animations are utilized for a blinking cursor and smooth transitions during gameplay.
  
This project serves as a fun and engaging platform for improving typing speed and accuracy, incorporating modern web development techniques like JavaScript for game logic, CSS for styling, and HTML for structure.
